# Deploy CipherTrust Manager on AWS using Terraform

[Terraform](https://terraform.io/) is an orchestrator created by HashiCorp. They have an Open Source version that you can download and manage yourself. They also have it "as a Service" where the orchestrator is managed by HashiCorp, themselves. For this script, we are using the Open Source version. There may be differences with the "as a Service" version. If you run into differences, feel free to update this repo.
